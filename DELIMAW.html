	One thing that I love about my family is that they're religious, God is always our first priority and I grew up having fear and respect for our mighty God because of them. &#9962 <br>
	They mold me to become a better person. &#128516 <br>
	 They're also funny, especially my father, he always tries to make things smooth for us. &#128526 <br>
	And of course my mother who's always doing her best to be there for us. &#128525 <br>
	I have two older brothers who are always on my back and against my back, I have a love and hate relationship with my older brothers. &#128541	<br>

      I love reading, the people around me know that so well. &#128563 <br>
      If I have free time, you will always see me reading something on my phone or holding a book that is related to my interests.&#128517 <br>
       I love cats, they're one of the most wonderful creatures God did. &#128008 <br>
       Actually, i have two cats. And my talent is also related to books, I  have these weird talents and that is to make fantasy stories and write poems. &#128514 <br>
      I also love nature, sunset and trees. &#127794 <br>
       Anything that is connected in nature is my favorite. &#129321 <br>
      My favorite food is adobong manok cooked by my mother. &#128523 <br>

	 My favorite quote is "Remember, you asked for growth. Don't be surprised when life challenges you." <br>
	This is my way to motivate myself because I know that I'm lazy and I want to change that negative behavior of mine.<br> 
	Sometimes, when there's a lot of things to do, I feel exhausted just by looking at it. <br>
	So, I always read this quote to remind myself that I need improvement and not another excuse. <br>
	 I believe that our future depends on us, there's another line in poem that is still lingered in my mind. <br>
	 It says there that "The child is the father of man" Meaning, that what my future will be is the consequences or results of what I did today. <br>

	 Moreover, My dream is actually shallow, it's just to live happily and have a stable financial life with my family. <br>
	 I want my parents to relax and be free from all stress and worries. <br>
	 I also want to be a great teacher someday, to share my knowledge in students and guide them in the best way I can. <br>
	However, there's this dreaam of mine that I am hoping I will be able to achieve. <br>
	 And that is to be a veterenary or doctors of pets such as cats and dogs. <br>
